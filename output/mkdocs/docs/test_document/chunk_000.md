# RAG Document Processing Utility - Test Document

## Introduction

This is a comprehensive test document designed to validate the RAG Document Processing Utility. The document contains various types of content including headings, paragraphs, lists, and structured information to test different chunking strategies.

## Document Structure

The document is organized into several main sections:
1. Overview and Purpose
2. Technical Specifications
3. Implementation Details
4. Testing Scenarios
5. Expected Outcomes

## Overview and Purpose

The RAG Document Processing Utility is designed to transform various document formats into an optimized structure for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. It implements a multi-stage, intelligence-enhanced pipeline that includes parsing, chunking, metadata extraction, quality assessment, and vector storage capabilities.

### Key Features

- **Multi-format Support**: Handles PDF, DOCX, TXT, HTML, and Markdown files
- **Intelligent Chunking**: Multiple strategies including fixed-size, structural, semantic, and hybrid approaches
- **LLM-Powered Metadata**: Advanced metadata extraction using OpenAI and other language models
- **Quality Assessment**: Comprehensive quality evaluation and monitoring
- **Security First**: File validation, sanitization, and threat detection
- **Vector Storage**: Integration with ChromaDB, Pinecone, Weaviate, and FAISS

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture

The system follows a modular design pattern with clear separation of concerns:

- **Configuration System**: Pydantic-based configuration management with environment variable support
- **Document Parsers**: Cascading strategy with multiple fallback options
- **Document Chunkers**: Multiple strategies with quality-based selection
- **Metadata Extractors**: LLM-powered extraction with fallback mechanisms
- **Quality Assessment**: Multi-dimensional evaluation and monitoring
- **Security Module**: Comprehensive file and content security valid
