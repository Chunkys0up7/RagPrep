Extractors**: LLM-powered extraction with fallback mechanisms
- **Quality Assessment**: Multi-dimensional evaluation and monitoring
- **Security Module**: Comprehensive file and content security validation

### Design Patterns

- **Factory Pattern**: For creating parser, chunker, and extractor instances
- **Strategy Pattern**: For different chunking and extraction approaches
- **Observer Pattern**: For quality monitoring and performance tracking
- **Template Method**: For defining processing workflows

### Data Flow

1. **Input Validation** → Security checks and file validation
2. **Document Parsing** → Multi-format parsing with fallbacks
3. **Content Chunking** → Intelligent chunking strategy selection
4. **Metadata Extraction** → LLM-enhanced metadata generation
5. **Quality Assessment** → Multi-dimensional quality evaluation
6. **Vector Storage** → Embedding generation and storage

## Implementation Details

### Configuration Management

The system uses Pydantic for robust, type-safe configuration management. All settings are validated at runtime and can be loaded from YAML files or environment variables.

### Security Features

- File type validation and sanitization
- Content analysis for security threats
- Executable, script, and macro detection
- Comprehensive security testing suite

### Performance Monitoring

- Real-time performance tracking
- Memory and CPU usage monitoring
- Quality metrics and continuous improvement
- Automated recommendations

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Text Processing

This document should be processed successfully through the entire pipeline:
- Parsing should extract text content and structure
- Chunking should create meaningful chunks based on headings
- Metadata extraction should identify entities, topics, and relationships
- Quality assessment should evaluate content completeness and structure

### Scenario 2: Chunking Strategy Testing

The document contains various heading levels and content types to test:
- **Fix
