- Quality assessment should evaluate content completeness and structure

### Scenario 2: Chunking Strategy Testing

The document contains various heading levels and content types to test:
- **Fixed-size chunking**: Should respect size limits and overlap
- **Structural chunking**: Should group content by heading hierarchy
- **Semantic chunking**: Should identify topic boundaries
- **Hybrid chunking**: Should combine multiple strategies intelligently

### Scenario 3: Metadata Extraction

The content includes:
- Technical terms and concepts
- Named entities (RAG, OpenAI, ChromaDB)
- Relationships between components
- Structured information suitable for summarization

### Scenario 4: Quality Assessment

The document should score well on:
- Content completeness (covers all major topics)
- Structure integrity (clear heading hierarchy)
- Metadata accuracy (extractable entities and topics)
- Overall quality (comprehensive and well-organized)

## Expected Outcomes

### Processing Results

1. **Successful Parsing**: Document should be parsed without errors
2. **Meaningful Chunks**: Chunks should preserve semantic meaning and structure
3. **Rich Metadata**: Extracted metadata should include entities, topics, and relationships
4. **High Quality Score**: Overall quality should exceed 0.8 (80%)
5. **Vector Storage**: Chunks should be successfully stored in the vector database

### Performance Metrics

- Processing time should be reasonable (< 30 seconds for this document)
- Memory usage should be within acceptable limits
- Quality scores should be consistent across different assessors
- Security checks should pass without warnings

## Conclusion

This test document provides a comprehensive foundation for validating the RAG Document Processing Utility. It covers all major functionality areas and should produce high-quality results that demonstrate the system's capabilities.
